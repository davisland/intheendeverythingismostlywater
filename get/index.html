<div class='centered'>
    <p class='bigger-text'>the online version of the zine has way way less content that the real thing. the real thing has loads of goodness stuffed inside.if you live in bryan/college station, don’t buy one of these, we’ll get you one for free, just email us or message us on facebook. if you were a contributor, send us an email and we’ll get one to you. the price is just so we can cover printing/shipping to people outside of my physical location. we make no profit from this.        </p>
