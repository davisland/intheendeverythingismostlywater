no one is really every found

they all ask

"where am I?"

it's normal the shock wears off fast.

oh yes.

I missed it.

a lot of people missed it;

still horrified at the thought of

not looking for glory,

for a miracle back home.

how often do we consider this?

thoughts slow,

we keep things imited,

but not too small

to catch site of another
