breathing in the car next to you<br><br>
wondering what our skin does<br><br>
when the buildings lose familiarity<br><br>
and absorb us into them<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
i feel half alive<br><br>
but my feet keep doing things<br><br>
i never asked or expected of them<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
you’re there<br><br>
you’re always there<br><br>
to put a jacket around my shoulders<br><br>
and kiss me in front of people<br><br>
until i feel like a person<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
we keep surviving and teaching<br><br>
one another to survive<br><br>
being alive and women and filled<br><br>
with hurting and everything<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
the sky is too big and real<br><br>
when you are beneath it with me<br><br>

after you go oh-for-one in cpr, kissing will suddenly scare the shit out of you. you get distracted. by death. <i> if we touch lips, you’ll taste the word ‘inadequate.’ a mouth fulla lemons. i’m sorry. last time i did this i failed. </i> you won’t kiss your future wife for the first time. you don’t think you could watch her die down the line. you keep your mouth to yourself. on fermented grapes, fried catfish, ya know– whatever’s already dead. compressing, chewing. inhaling, inhaling.

I don’t know a lot about presidents, but I have met a lot of mothers, and it’s basically the same thing. Your mother works at a bank and I wonder if she’s still careful with the pennies even though they’re worthless. Mothers are usually careful, except when they’re cutting your hair in their living rooms and you’re thinking no no no no as you watch inches and inches get mixed up in the shag carpet. This has happened to me and I hope it never happens to you, just like I hope a lot of things that have happened to me don’t happen to you: shin splints, split lips, un-popped popcorn kernel up the nose. And other things, sadder things. I am not imaginative or hopeful enough to create a future for you that I would be satisfied with, and I definitely couldn’t do in 140 characters. Just remember that I’ve stuffed enough things up my nose for the both of us.
