mini blueberry muffins</br>

dimple on her right cheek</br>
keeps coming back</br>
I look for it</br>

*poem by jose rico*

<br><br><br><br>

The back of Diana’s jumpsuit reads, Meter Reader. She walks neighborhood patterns, sidewalks and yards and electricity meters, Gate Place, Pied Grove Summit, Jagged Blossom Road. Cars pass in dopplering swells of engine drones.<br><br> 
The next house is vacant. Wood boards cover the door and windows. For whatever reason, the electricity utility account is still open and active.<br><br> 
There are crows hunt and peck the yard. As she crosses the grass, the murder flees in the direction that she walks, but not far. Once more, they flee as she approaches, also in the direction she walks.<br><br>
The side of the house is face-like. The second-story windows are like eyes, and the longer first-story window is the mouth. From the gray-plastic meter, she notes the electricity usage. About to leave, she notices something in the grass amongst the crows. Diana approaches the birds. And the murder scatters all directions out and way. Resting providentially in the grass, there is this jewel-cased cassette. The j-card cover reads, DEEP SECRET.<br><br> 
Diana stands over the cassette. The murder caw caw caws their counter-point chorus on the roof and in the trees. She leans over. She picks up the cassette.<br><br> 
Tranquility comes over the murder, over the streets. Diana’s footsteps are grass-hushed. She returns to the neighborhood patters of streets and sidewalks and yards and electricity meters.<br><br>
She rides the van with other meter readers back to the offices. She drives her car with the tape in the passenger seat back to the apartment.<br><br>
The dust from her gray-plastic boom-box rolls into the cloud that fades as fast as it forms. The tape slides into her tape player. She presses play click, but it does not play. In the battery compartment, she finds black corrosion. Diana starts typing this text message, Does anyone still listen to cassette tapes? But before pressing send, she hears her roommate in the kitchen. Wade clangs, clinks, and returns to his room.<br><br> 
There is the unmistakable beep of the microwave, but Wade does not return to the kitchen for his tea-ready water. 
Diana deletes her text, she goes into the kitchen. She sets the microwave for one second, and the second ends with the beep. But this time Wade returns to the kitchen for the warm water. And while Wade steeps his tea, she sits at the kitchen table, and she tells him about the tape she found.<br><br>
Wade goes to his room, and he returns with this gray-plastic, handheld tape recorder. It has this built-in speaker. He joins her at the table.<br><br>
Diana presses play click, and the tape starts spinning. That fuzzy, warm, low-fi tape wurr fills the kitchen. It fills Diana and Wade’s thoughts. It fills these words as they gently reveal themselves to you. As the wisps of letters reach out from this text, the shared-imaginary wurr from the tape fills your thoughts, and it gathers your deep secret. It carries the secret across these tufts of text, and then the voice in your head is playing on the cassette in Diana and Wade’s kitchen. It layers on the warm wurr. Diana and Wade quietly listen to your deep secret. Diana rests her head on the table, and Wade watches the crow framed on the branch in the kitchen window. 
When the cassette ends click, Diana shrugs. She leaves the tape with Wade. She goes back to her room.<br><br> 
Wade takes the cassette apart. He splices the tape into this loop of the voice in your head. He spends the rest of the day laying in bed, listening to the secret loop.<br><br>

Our Bank of America love (too big to fail) has a local branch on Southwest by Colgate. Every night I drive down there, envelope in hand, and make a withdrawal from the ATM.<br><br>

I never check the receipt, but lately when I enter my PIN, I get the cold sweats.<br><br>

On my way home, the headlight goes out. “It’s ok,” I think, “I’ll just skip lunch.”<br><br>
