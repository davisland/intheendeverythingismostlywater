Jesus goes to bed wearing socks, meaning you can’t really see where the nails went in. He tells the fish to keep their voices down. How quiet it soon is in the forest. The night is riddled with peculiarities, mistakes, contradictions, and historical inconsistencies. There are reports that Chinese hackers may be responsible. A tornado touches down in LA, after which Panzers roll down the street under the broken lights. Here 40,000 books were burned. Someone blames the times. The Minister of Drought hints at a conspiracy. Three angels dressed all in black have been caught on a surveillance camera arguing. It isn’t so much a clue as haunted graffiti, the sound of one hand clapping, nowhere and all around.
