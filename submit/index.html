    <p class="bigger-text">if you want to submit to the zine (poetry, prose, visual art, chat logs, etc), email everythingismostlywater@gmail.com a .doc, .docx, .pages, .pdf, .jpg, or .png file with “ZINE SUBMISSION” in the subject line. we’re looking for weirder, experimental, and more abstract writing. as with any journal, read our other issues to get a feel for what we look for. some other presses we really like are “the newer york,” “have u seen my whale,” “civil coping mechanisms,”“bear parade,” and “boost house” so read those to catch a feel for what we like as well! our print edition is in black and white, so if you’re submitting visual art please keep that in mind. if there isn’t room for your stuff in the next month’s zine, it will be considered for the month after. deadline for the february edition is: february 7thh
